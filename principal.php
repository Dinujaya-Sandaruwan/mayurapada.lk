  As the present principal of Mayurapada Central College I feel extremely honoured, privileged and delighted to send this message at the official website of our school.
<br><br><br>
We live today in a world that is so very different from the one we grew up in, the one we were educated in, Aristotle once said that “Educating the mind without educating the heart
is no education at all”, Even as we import education to match the advancement in technology and globalization, we march our students ahead with moral values and principles. We
endeavor constantly to instill these qualities in our students. We pride ourselves to help them grow and develop into sensitive and responsible citizens of the future.
<br><br>
Education plays an important and vital role in enabling a person to face a real life situation with adequate knowledge. in Mayurapada we are making our best effort to give quality
education to our students. It is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations. I believe in upholding high
standards with an absolute commitment to strive to understand and improve the quality of education process, using team strategies, while centering on student achievement.
<br><br>
The aim of our school is to help our students to grow into fine human beings who are capable to face the challenges of the present world. Therefore, student academic and social
growth will continue to be our focus. As the principal, I will support and guide teachers and staff in providing the best educational setting for our students. I look forward to working
together to continue the successful work at Mayurapada. We give lot of importance to make disicipline a core value, encourage students to develop a sence of responsibility
